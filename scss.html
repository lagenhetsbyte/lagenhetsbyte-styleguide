        <h1>Pre-processing</h1>
        <p>
            CSS pre-processing allows us to write DRY code that will be faster, 
            more efficient and easier to maintain. We have chosen SCSS as our 
            CSS pre-processor. SCSS (not SASS) is more powerful and offers more 
            features than plain CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            After processing SCSS to CSS, we minify. The minified file should 
            be placed in the 'assets' folder.
